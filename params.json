Then it'll find the emoji with the closest average color and replace the area with the matching emoji:\r\n\r\n![converted test image](http://imgur.com/gUTKsuH.png)\r\n\r\nIt can get pretty slow depending on the resolution you're looking for, so if you're doing a large GIF I'd recommend running it as a still image first, which will convert the first frame and let you see what the final output will look like.\r\n\r\n### Options, Options, Options\r\n\r\nat least one of these are mandatory: \r\n* `-g [filename]` or `--gif [filename]` - indicate location of the gif to convert\r\n* `-i [filename]` or `--image [filename]` - indicate location of the still image to convert\r\n\r\noptional options: \r\n* `-s [int]` or `--size [int]` - height of the emoji in pixels. default is 8. smaller size = longer conversion time\r\n* `-z [int]` or `--zoom [int]` - multiply output file height and width by this number. default is 1. larger = longer conversion time \r\n* `-o [int]` or `--offset [int]` - randomly move emojis by this many pixels. default is 0. #FreeOffset\r\n* `-c [int]` or `--coverage [int]` - generally the emoji finder will use the emoji that is closest to the color for a given pixel area. setting this will prefer emojis with fewer transparent pixels which sometimes looks better\r\n* `-q` or `--quiet` - silences all output and updates to the console\r\n\r\nutilities (run these without any other options):\r\n* `-t` or `--tmp` - deletes all temporary images in the tmp/ folder\r\n* `-m` or `--map` - regenerate emoji color map\r\n* `-h` or `--help` - print these options to the console","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
